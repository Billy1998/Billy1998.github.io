<p>Here are some of my favorite films and TV shows that I highly suggest you watch:</p>

<p>One of my favorite movie is <i>Alien</i> because of the suspense that an alien can attack any one of te charcaters at a given time. <i>Alien</i>is about a crew bound on a return trip to Earth. However, they discover a  
distress signal, from a nearby planetoid. Following standard company policy for such situations, the Nostromo lands on the planetoid, sustaining damage from the planetoid's dusty atmosphere in the process. They soon discover that an alien is slowly killing them one by one and that they need to get off the planet. After watching the movie Alien you’ll be watching the sequels which are equally as great as the first one </p>

<p>Another favorite movie of mine is <i>Jurassic Park</i>. I am found of <i>Jurassic Park</i> because when I was a kid I wanted to be an archaeologist and dig up dinosaur bones! When I discovered the movie it only peaked my interest of being an archaeologist even more, which is why I’m so found of this movie. The plot is about a theme park called Jurassic park populated with cloned dinosaurs. The owner of this park decides to show off his park to a few select archaeologists and his grandkids before opening it. However, the dinosuars are able to escape from their enclosed cages and wreak havoc on the invited gueats and the employees. </p>

<p>One of my favorite TV shows is <i>Rick and Morty</i>. <i>Rick and Morty</i> is an animated science-fiction, satire comedy series about an alocholic scientist, Rick, who moved into his daughter's home. He spends most of his time with his grandson, Morty, on dangerous and surreal adventures throughtout space and the multiverse. I recommend this show if you are a person who appreciates science fiction and doesn’t mind comedy that may be dark at some points.</p>

<center><img src="Eyewitness.jpg" height="50%" width="50%"></center>
<p>The tv show, <i>Eyewitness</i>, is a recently new show that is centered around a couple, two teenage boys, who witness a triple homicide and how they decide to remain silent. But they soon learn that what they saw cannot be unseen and when you witness a horrible event it changes everything. The show also focuses on a former city homicide detective who left her career to become a small-town sheriff. With a killer on the loose who is desperate to silence any link to the killings, she will stop at nothing to solve the case and bring peace back to her town. I highly recommend watching this show because the plot follows the lifes of the teenage boys, the killer, and the sheriff and they interact with one another to further develope the story, which creates a dramatic tv series.
