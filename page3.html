<p>Here is just a couple of things that I’m interested in:</p>

<p>One of my interests is ceramics. I became interested in ceramics because I took two ceramics classes in high school and I really enjoyed creating art from clay. In high school I created an owl ceramic coil pot, a head of Edward Scissorhands, a Greek pot, and a fall themed tile. If I could I really hope to continue to do ceramics as a hobby and have my own setup because I want to continue doing ceramics even if I’m going to be an accountant.</p>

<p>Another one of my interests is drawing. Unfortunately I’m not the best at drawing, but when I have the time I try to improve my drawing skills. As of now I’m not able to work on my drawing skills but I do hope for a time when I’ll be able to start drawing again. Hopefully I’ll be able to draw during this summer because I do want to improve my skills and I just need to make more time to draw between working and my free time. In the future I hope to be able to draw people and nature because I find drawing people to a fun challenge and I find drawing nature to be peaceful.</p>
