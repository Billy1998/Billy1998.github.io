As you know I’m Billy Keller and I’m currently a student at UMaine. I’m studying for Accounting because I’ve always enjoyed math and I became interested in accounting during my senior year in high school. In my senior year in high school I took an accounting class which made me want to become an accountant. Before I decided to become an accountant I knew that I wanted to have a job that dealt with math because I’ve always enjoyed working with numbers. Even though I’m  just a freshman in college and only been through my first semester, I can’t wait to continue getting my degree and working towards my goal of becoming an accountant.
